## Inspiration
This is my capstone project.

Current file management solutions like Google Drive keep their file types as generic as possible in order to cater to wide audiences. They fail to tailor their systems to unique collaborative experiences like note-taking. Note-taking apps like Evernote and Google Keep tailor their apps to note-taking, but fail to provide robust or real-time collaboration. _noter_ tries to eliminate the compromise.

In the future, an application similar to noter could become a platform for many different collaborative experiences other than note-taking. However, it's unreasonable to try and cater to everyone. So, the intention is that 'noter' could add more file types to specifically improve the ideation process for startups. Design wireframes, user surveys, code samples, etc, could all be streamlined through an online experience.

## What it does
Think of it as an improvement to Google Drive in certain regards, including:
- file management UX redesign
- additional note taking UX including audio transcription and realtime collaboration
- UI redesign

## How I built it
- MongoDB through mlab and mongoose.js
- socket.io API
- react app

## Where can I see it?
Please see screenshots on DevPost [here](https://devpost.com/software/noter-8ua4f6) or view our capstone slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EuqLow9B4YJVL2q6QtmFVF-G7MoM-qym5FbU5YbqjGw/edit?usp=sharing).

The application will inevitably stop working due to mlab being sunsetted soon, therefore I'm not planning on deploying this application. Sorry!
