# noter
This is a web application for 67-475 of Fall 2018.

noter seeks to combine the collaborative nature of existing file management solutions (such as Google Drive) and the
smooth user experiences of focused note-taking apps (such as Evernote).

Further documentation will be written upon completion of the project.
